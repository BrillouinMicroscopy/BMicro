Development
===========

This section gives on overview about everything you need to know if you
wish to contribute to
`bmlab <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/bmlab/>`_ or
`BMicro <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro>`_.


Development workflow
====================
We use `GitHub projects <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro/projects>`_
to manage the development workflow of bmlab and BMicro. The main development project board is
`Brillouin Evaluation in Python <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro/projects/1>`_.

The development is split into "User Stories", each of which is a
collection of issues (identified via titles in the issues). The current work in progress
(WIP) branch is named according to the currently active user story
(e.g. `1-smoke-test`). Issues that are not part of the current user story
should still be addressed in the current WIP branch.

Once you wish to address an issue, drag it from the "Open" or "Ready"
column of the project board to the "In progress" column. Once you finished
working on an issue, drag it to the "Done" column, but don't close it yet
(It should be discussed first in the dev meeting).

**Notes**:

- Please write test functions and keep code coverage above 90%.

- Please make sure to always edit the
  changelog for
  `BMicro <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro/blob/main/CHANGELOG>`__
  or
  `bmlab <https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/bmlab/blob/main/CHANGELOG>`__.

- Please try to always pull with rebase

  ::

      git pull --rebase

  instead of

  ::

      git pull

  to prevent confusions in the commit history.


Documentation
=============
It is always helpful to have code examples and thorough descriptions
in a documentation. We use sphinx-autodoc for the
:ref:`code reference <sec_coderef>`, which means that the docstrings
of your functions and classes are automatically rendered. Please
make sure that this is working properly - go to the ``docs`` directory
and execute:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    sphinx-build . _build

This will create a a file ``_build/index.html`` which you can open in
your favorite browser. This also applies to bmlab.



Tests
=====
We try to adhere to test-driven development. Please always write test
functions for your code. Make sure you have the required packages
installed::

    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

You can run all tests via

::

    python -m pytest tests

To check for code coverage, make sure the `coverage` Python package is
installed and run

::

    coverage run --source="bmicro" -m pytest tests
    coverage report


Making a new release
====================
The release process of BMicro is completely automated. All you need to know
is that you have to create an incremental tag:

::

    git tag -a "0.1.3"
    # or (if you have set up PGP)
    git tag -s "0.1.3"
    # and finally
    git push --tags

For more information on how automatic deployment to PyPI works, please
read on.


Continuous integration
======================
The following things are automated:

- pytest and flake8 on Linux, macOS, and Windows via GitHub Actions:
  https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro/actions?query=workflow%3AChecks

  You should always check that all checks pass before you merge a pull request
  (A green state on your local machine does not mean a global green state).
- automatic deployment to PyPI on tag creation via GitHub Actions:
  https://github.com/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Release+to+PyPI%22

  Paul MÃ¼ller created the `BMicro <https://pypi.org/project/bmicro/>`_ package on
  PyPI and gave the user ``ci_bm`` permission to upload new releases. The
  password for this user is an
  `organization secret <https://github.com/organizations/BrillouinMicroscopy/settings/secrets/actions>`_.
- documentation is built automatically (for all tags and for the latest commit
  to the main branch) on readthedocs: https://readthedocs.org/projects/BMicro/builds/
- coverage statistics are done with codecov: https://codecov.io/gh/BrillouinMicroscopy/BMicro

  Please try stay above 90% coverage.

Badges for all of these CI tasks are in the main ``README.rst`` file.
